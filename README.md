#  Pattern Detection using Manual Convolution

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of **convolution** from scratch to detect specific **visual patterns** (such as a letter "C") in a grayscale image. Instead of using deep learning frameworks, this project performs manual convolution using **NumPy** for educational purposes.

---

##  Project Overview

- Converts a grayscale image into a **binary matrix** using a threshold.
- Defines a custom **pattern matrix** (e.g., letter "C") to search for in the image.
- Implements **manual convolution** logic using NumPy.
- Detects and visualizes where the given pattern occurs within the original image matrix.

##  Key Concepts

- Binary image conversion
- Manual implementation of convolution
- Pattern matching in 2D matrices
- Matrix manipulation using NumPy
